1. They are similar in that they all have decks on a board, and have essentially the same behavior such as
removing cards and then they're replaced. They are different because they have a different number of cards 
and some cards have different point values and therefore act differently.

2. When the GUI program starts, it is provided with an object of a class that inherits from Board. It uses
the instance variables included in the object provided along with the instance variables in the abstract class.

3. They do cover all the differences because the difference in point values is covered in the instance variables
of the different classes, and the different rules are covered in the abstract methods.
